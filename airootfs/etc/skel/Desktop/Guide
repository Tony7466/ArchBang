====Installation====

To run installer either run sudo abinstall in a terminal or via main menu.

If you wish to set up partitions before running installer either do so manually in a terminal or use gparted.

Once complete then simply mount new partitions to /mnt.

The installer is menu driven and very easy to follow.

===Pacman===

To get pacman running live you will need a working network connection, either wired [connects automatically] or wireless via network icon on panel [click on it!].

Live you do not need to do the following commands but post install you will need to set up pacman keys:

sudo pacman-key --init
sudo pamcan-key --populate

Check/Setup mirrorlist you may have it already setup via installer [working network] or you can check it in a terminal by running abserver script.

Update pacman keyring and packages:

sudo pacman -Syyu archlinux-keyring

Then you can search for a package of choice using:

sudo pacman -Ss

Install a pacakge using

sudo pacman -S

====Tips and tricks?====

Desktop Keyboard Layout Live check file ~/.config/openbox/autostart, edit line setxkbmap “us” (change us to your keyboard layout)

Want to change or add autostart applications that run on logging into Openbox window manager

Then look in ~/.config/openbox/autostart file and make changes, make sure you add a '&' to end of line so application will run in the background.

Also in that file is where wallpaper is set:

feh –bg-scale ~/Backgrounds/graveyard.jpg

Put your new wallpaper in ~/Backgrounds then edit the above line to your new wallpaper file name.
