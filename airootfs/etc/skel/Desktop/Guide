====Sway Window Manager====

Sway runs under Wayland and no longer depends on Xorg or X11 applications. Will give a brief overview of ArchBang version but more information can be found on Arch wiki [link]

Some useful keybinds are:

Super+t terminal
Super+w Firefox browser
Super+f Thunar file manager

You will also see launchers on Waybar panel for above, as well as workspaces, networking, volume, cpu usage, ram usage, time and date, tray and power options. 

Also applications can be started from Wofi [similar to Rofi/Dmenu] by using Super + d. If you want to open htop a terminal application use Shift key plus return.

Window manager controls:

Super+Shift+Space toggle window floating

Super+Sapce switch between floating and tiled windows

Super+[0-9] select workspace [1 -10]

Super+Shift+[0-9] move selcted window to given workspace

Super+q closes a window and the application in most cases, some gui apps will use there own keybinds.

Super+[Arrow keys] move around workspace windows. adding shift will move windows around workspace.

Super+Shift+c is important if you make any changes to sway it will reload all configs.

Super+b opens Wofi with a full list of keybinds in Sway 

====Installation====

To run installer either run sudo abinstall in a terminal of use Super + i keybinding

If you wish to set up partitions before running installer either do so manually in a terminal or use gparted [note to work under wayland you will need to use sudo -E gparted].

Once complete then simply mount new partitions to /mnt. 

The installer is menu driven and very easy to follow.

===Pacman===

To get pacman running live you will need a working network connection, either wired [connects automatically] or wireless [open a terminal and run menu driven tmtui].

Check/Setup mirrorlist you may have it already setup via installer [working network] or you can check it in a terminal by running abserver script.

Update pacman keyring and packages:

    sudo pacman -Syyu archlinux-keyring

Then you can search for a package of choice using:

	sudo pacman -Ss <package_name>

Install a pacakge using

	sudo pacman -S <package_name>


Post install you can set up pacman as above but you will need to enable pacman-keys

	sudo pacman-key --init
	sudo pacman-key populate
