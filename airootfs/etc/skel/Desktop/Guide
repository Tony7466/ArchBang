===Pacman===

To get pacman running you will need a working network connection, either wired [connects automatically] or wireless [click icon on panel and find your named network].

Open a terminal [Super + t] then update pacmand database:

    sudo pacman -Syy

Then you can install a package of choice using:

	sudo pacman -S <package_name>

Autologin is disabled during install, you will end up at a log in prompt. Enter your chosen username and password to log in.

If you have not set your local mirrors during install you should edit them. Either use config_edit script and select mirrorlist or visit https://archlinux.org/mirrorlist/.
